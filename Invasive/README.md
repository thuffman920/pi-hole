Current Categories:
 * URL Shorteners — These services obfuscate the full URL path, which has been used to redirect users to malicious sites.
     - In this list, you will find specific services used by genuine websites, like X (formerly Twitter). So, using these services is very risky, but if you want to be protected from malicious links, you can use this as a good jumping-off point.
     - I have provided the associate URL Shortening service, so if you would like to modify this list for personal use, you are free to do so.
 * Top Known Pornographic Sites — These are sites that distribute explicitly pornographic content. In other words, these businesses specialize in making, distributing, or profiting from pornographic entertainment.
     - Use this list to block pornographic sites from your network, but do so at your own risk. Some of these sites are known for collecting a lot of personal data (e.g., IP address, Country, City, and State). So, restricting these sites will aid in keeping a cleaner digital footprint.

Please be aware that these domains have a lot of risk in using them. Use these at your own risk, you have been warned.
