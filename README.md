  * Non-invasive Domains: These domains will block known bad sites. They may impact users, but they are built to protect users against malware, phishing attacks, and the like. They are broken down into parts. You are free to add any or all of these domains.
      - Typosquatting Domains [RECOMMENDED] — These domains target users using typo mistakes. This is a safe list to incorporate and is highly recommended to protect end-users.
      - Adware / Spyware [AVAILABLE] — There are possible issues here. The domains I have acquired are unwanted but may not all be Adware/Spyware domains. There will be overlaps with Advertising Technology (classically abbreviated as "AdTech"). So, until I have combed over these domains, please use them at your own risk.
      - Malicious [RECOMMENDED] —
      - Advertisements [AVAILABLE] — These have the significant risk of unwillingly breaking websites. Use this list at your own risk. I will continue to work on these domains to improve their accuracy.
      - Ransomware [RECOMMENDED] — 
  * Invasive Domains: These domains will block personally selected unwanted sites. I am trying to categorize domains, and if you would like to add a block for these domains, please feel free to do so. I don't intend to use all of these blocklists; they are for documentation purposes.
      - Porn URLS [AVAILABLE] — These domains
      - URL Shorteners [RECOMMENDED] — 

These blocklists are being formulated and have a considerable risk of breaking websites. Please use these blocklists at your own risk. If you would like to contribute, please don't hesitate to contact me. Just to let you know, any contributions will be heavily analyzed, verified, and adjusted according to what I find.
