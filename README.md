  * Non-invasive Domains: These domains will block known bad sites. These may be impact users, but it for their security. They are broken down into parts. You are free to add any or all of these domains.
      - Typosquatting Domains [RECOMMENDED] - These domains target users by relying on typo mistakes. As of currently, this is a safe list to incorporate and highly recommended to protect end-users.
      - Adware / Spyware [AVAILABLE] - There are possible issues here. The domains that I have acquire are unwanted, but they may not all be Adware/Spyware domains. There are going to be overlaps with Advertising Technology (classically abbreviated as "AdTech"). So, until I have combed over these domains, please use these at your own risk.
      - Malicious [RECOMMENDED] -
      - Advertisements [AVAILABLE] - These do have a major risk of unwillingly breaking websites. Use this list at your own risk. I will continue work on these domains to improve the accuracy.
  * Invasive Domains: These domains will block personally selected unwanted sites. I am trying to categorize domains and if you would like to add a block for these domains, please feel free to do so. I don't intend on using all of these blocklists, it is for documentation purposes.
      - Porn URLS [AVAILABLE] - These domains 

These blocklists are currently being formulated and have a huge risk of breaking websites. Please use these blocklists at your own risk. If you would like to contribute, please reach out to me. I will scrutinize, verify the functionality, and adjust according to what I find.
